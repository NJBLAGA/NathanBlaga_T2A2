### **Background:**

ANZ Research economist Adelaide Timbrell told The New Daily sales of home gym equipment spiked after commercial gyms were closed by government.

The initial surge petered out before the end of March, but Ms Timbrell said the decline in sales was caused more by a lack of supply than a lack of demand

Home exercise equipment is a niche market – most people generally join gyms instead, so supply chain issues were exacerbated by COVID-19 a lot more than other more mainstream products,” she said.

Following the federal government’s indefinite closure of gyms and indoor sporting venues that began at midday yesterday, Australian consumers have begun panic buying home gym equipment.

For weeks the unprecedented demand brought on by COVID-19 has seen supermarket shelves stripped of stock, and we’re now seeing similar scenes at retail stores selling gym equipment.

But that was pre-Covid. Now, with gyms closed and outings comprehensively curtailed, we’re all innovating; fitness instructors have been quick to move online, yoga classes have taken to Zoom, and sales of exercise equipment and downloads of fitness apps are all on the rise. Between January and March in the US, for example, sales of fitness equipment shot up 55% as lockdowns began to be activated. Some gyms are even introducing “foster” programmes for their equipment during the pandemic – lending out machines to members for a fee.

Stark, the University of Leeds professor, thinks it’s too early to tell whether coronavirus could lead to a new home workout boom. He thinks the new online classes tap into something that didn’t exist in home fitness before, but believes that the lure of the gym may prove stronger in the long term.
